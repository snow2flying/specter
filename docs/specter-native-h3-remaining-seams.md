# Specter Native H3 Remaining Gap Ledger

Date: 2026-05-25
Repo: `/Users/jaredboynton/__devlocal/specter`

## Read This First

This is the current native H3 gap ledger. It is intentionally not a change log.

- Active gaps are the only items listed under `Active Gaps`.
- Solved items moved to `Closed Gaps / Regression Guards`.
- Historical benchmark commands and long per-patch notes belong in artifacts, tests, or `CHANGELOG.md`, not in this ledger.
- Runtime native H3 remains hand-rolled; `quiche`, `tokio-quiche`, `h3-quinn`, `reqwest_h3`, `quinn`, and `s2n-quic` are benchmark/comparator surfaces unless explicitly noted as transport-only baselines.

## Claim Boundary

| Area | Current claim | Proof | Still caveated |
|---|---|---|---|
| Native H3 HTTP | Specter beats required Rust H3 HTTP comparator rows in local same-fixture runs. | `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-25-rfc9220-suite-n100.json` has `superiority_gate.pass = true`, required rows present, and zero fixture events. | Keep repeated/CI fixture runs treating fatal fixture events as blockers; ignored post-application packet-open noise is filtered before artifact emission. |
| RFC9220 full tunnel suite | Specter beats low-level `quiche` and `tokio-quiche` on echo, close/FIN, and slow-consumer mixed rows at n=100. | Same artifact has `rfc9220_full_suite_superiority_gate.pass = true` for all nine required tunnel rows. | Specter adapters reuse one client across samples; low-level comparators open a fresh QUIC connection per sample. |
| QUIC transport-only baselines | `quinn_transport` and optional `s2n_quic_transport` have measured echo adapters. | `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-quic-transport-local.json`, `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-s2n-quic-transport-local.json`, and smoke artifacts. | They are not H3 rows and are outside H3 superiority gates. |
| Runtime dependency boundary | Native H3/QUIC runtime is not shelled out to `quiche` or `h3-quinn`. | Runtime lives under `src/transport/h3/`; third-party H3 clients live in `benches/native_h3_vs_rust_clients/`. | BoringSSL remains the TLS backend; TLS fingerprinting is constrained by its ClientHello machinery where noted below. |

## Active Gaps

| Priority | Gap | Current state | Next proof needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| P2 | Browser ACK parity | Threshold + `max_ack_delay_ms` timer paths exist for client/server/fixture, including tuned benchmark profile support. | Capture Chrome/Firefox QUIC ACK thresholds/delays by version and compare against Specter defaults and `ack_eliciting_threshold = 128`. |
| P2 | TLS/H3 capture presets | Certificate compression, deterministic-vs-browser-permuted extension policy, raw ordered transport parameters, session replay, and 0-RTT controls exist. | Capture-derived raw transport-parameter presets and explicit extension-list ordering beyond BoringSSL permutation policy. |
| P2 | Cross-protocol capacity policy | Native H3 streaming bodies and RFC9220 tunnels expose public capacity snapshots; internal byte-bounded H3 body/tunnel flow control and fair send scheduling exist. | Unified H1/H2/H3 capacity knobs and policy docs where API consumers need one cross-protocol control surface. |

## Closed Gaps / Regression Guards

Keep these under regression coverage; do not relist them as active gaps.

| Area | Closed state |
|---|---|
| Same-fixture H3 HTTP proof | Required rows for `specter_native`, `quiche_direct`, `tokio_quiche`, `h3_quinn`, and `reqwest_h3` are measured with the H3 superiority gate passing. |
| RFC9220 full tunnel-suite superiority | Echo, close/FIN, and slow-consumer mixed rows for Specter and low-level `quiche`/`tokio-quiche` are measured at n=100 with the full-suite gate passing. |
| `tokio_quiche` body/FIN blocker | Latest persisted full same-fixture proofs emit no fixture events; the previous body timeout is not reproducing in current artifacts. |
| Fixture event classification | Fixture events serialize stable `category` and `fatal` fields; ignored post-application short-header packet-open noise is suppressed from logs and artifacts, while non-ignored packet errors remain serialized with `category` and `fatal`; current release artifacts have zero events. |
| QUIC connection IDs | Required server transport parameters include original-destination, initial-source, and retry-source CIDs; server/client 1-RTT routing uses the expected CIDs. |
| Retry and Version Negotiation | Retry integrity, Retry-driven Initial restart, VN-driven version selection/restart, loop guards, and no-overlap errors are implemented. |
| PATH_CHALLENGE primitives | Client packetization and matching PATH_RESPONSE validation are implemented; remaining work is migration lifecycle, not token handling. |
| Post-handshake NEW_CONNECTION_ID | `NativeQuicServerHandshake::build_server_new_connection_id_packet` can issue migration CIDs after application keys, and the local same-fixture server advertises/registers a migration CID after HandshakeDone. |
| Server-side path migration lifecycle | Server-side PATH_RESPONSE packetization, migrated-peer PATH_CHALLENGE issuance, peer-address-bound PATH_RESPONSE validation, and same-fixture peer promotion after validation are implemented. |
| Driver anti-amplification gating | Native H3 driver records received bytes per path, promotes validated migrated paths, and routes outbound sends through RFC9000 § 8.1 budget checks for unvalidated paths. |
| RFC9002 recovery/PTO core | Per-space RTT/PTO/loss state, congestion response, CRYPTO PTO retransmission, app-space PTO, and mock/same-fixture server wake paths are implemented. |
| Recovery soak/backoff validation | Repeated PTO backoff/reset, packet/time-threshold loss, persistent congestion collapse, early timer-poll no-op behavior, Initial/Handshake CRYPTO PTO retransmission, and client/server app-space STREAM retransmission are covered by recovery and handshake regression tests. |
| Close drain | Client, mock-server, and same-fixture server retain/replay protected `CONNECTION_CLOSE` packets during bounded drain windows and suppress non-close sends after draining. |
| Key update | 1-RTT key update has traffic-secret/key-phase rotation, previous-key retention, and local-update ACK gating. |
| ACK_ECN and ECN marking | ACK_ECN encode/decode, counter validation, CE growth tracking, congestion response, socket receive ECN reporting, and fingerprint-controlled outbound ECN marking are implemented. |
| PMTU probing | Native H3 has probe policy, PING+PADDING probes, ACK-only promotion, and loss-driven search-ceiling reduction. |
| ACK timer/decimation | Pending ACKs flush on `max_ack_delay_ms`; idle handling treats delayed ACKs as driver work. |
| TLS features | Certificate compression, session-ticket capture/replay, `NativeH3SessionCache`, 0-RTT opt-in policy, and handshake-status reporting are wired. |
| Raw ordered transport parameters | Caller-supplied raw ordered QUIC transport parameter lists encode in order with dynamic CID placeholders and pool-key separation. |
| H3 scheduling/fairness | Request-body/tunnel DATA class rotation, per-stream rotation, adaptive DATA budgets, and origin-fair slow-path dispatch are implemented. |
| Flow control/backpressure | Streaming responses and RFC9220 tunnels release receive credit on public byte consumption; RFC9220 outbound sends use byte permits and release them on transmit. |
| H3/RFC9220 capacity metrics | `Body::h3_capacity()` reports native H3 streaming body buffer pressure; `H3Tunnel::capacity()` reports RFC9220 inbound/outbound byte-budget pressure. |
| RFC9220 comparator rows | Specter echo/close/mixed rows and low-level `quiche`/`tokio-quiche` echo/close/mixed rows are persisted at n=100. |
| Transport-only adapters | `quinn_transport` and optional `s2n_quic_transport` have measured rows and are explicitly outside H3 superiority gates. |

## Current Proof Artifacts

| `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-25-rfc9220-suite-n100.json` | Current combined H3 HTTP + RFC9220 full-suite proof artifact. | H3 HTTP gate passes; RFC9220 full-suite gate passes; zero fixture events; all required tunnel rows are n=100. |
| `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-25-rfc9220-n100-plus-close-and-mixed-comparators.json` | Prior combined artifact before mixed adapter fairness fix and suite-gate promotion. | Retained for historical comparison. |
| `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-rfc9220-n100.json` | Earlier RFC9220 echo-only proof. | Echo gate passed; superseded by suite artifact. |
| `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-quic-transport-local.json` | Transport-only `quinn_transport`/`s2n_quic_transport` baseline. | Lower-layer echo rows only. |

## Next Execution Order

1. Capture browser ACK behavior and calibrate native ACK thresholds/timers against Chrome/Firefox versions.
2. Add capture-derived TLS/H3 presets for raw transport parameters and extension ordering where BoringSSL allows control.
3. Design unified H1/H2/H3 capacity knobs only if API consumers need one cross-protocol control surface.
