# Specter Native H3 / WebSocket Performance Gap Update

Date: 2026-05-24
Repo: `/Users/jaredboynton/__devlocal/specter`

## Current status

- Native H3 runtime remains quiche-free in Specter's no-default normal dependency tree and H3 runtime sources.
- The isolated benchmark crate covers the required widely used Rust H3 clients: direct `quiche`, `tokio-quiche`, `h3` + `h3-quinn`, and `reqwest` HTTP/3.
- `reqwest_h3` now works against the local native fixture by using a preconfigured rustls/quinn config pinned to `TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `h3` ALPN.
- Native QUIC ACK state now clears pending ACKs after send without forgetting ACK ranges, preventing the ACK storm that caused repeated streaming requests to hang.
- Native QUIC frame codec now round-trips RFC9000 ACK_ECN frames (`0x03`) with ECN counters, and loss detection applies ACK_ECN ranges like ordinary ACK ranges.
- Native H3 now exposes a reusable `H3Handle` path for low-overhead repeated requests and a same-URL hot handle cache for the higher-level `H3Client` path.
- The local benchmark fixture now starts a fresh native H3 server fixture per client in the full matrix, avoiding cross-client fixture state/noise.
- Same-fixture measured proof is live again: `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-full-local-smoke.json` passed `--require-superiority` with real measured rows for `specter_native`, `quiche_direct`, `tokio_quiche`, `h3_quinn`, `reqwest_h3`, `quinn_transport`, and `specter_native_rfc9220_tunnel`.
- The optional feature run `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-full-local-with-s2n-smoke.json` also passed `--require-superiority` and includes a real measured `s2n_quic_transport` row.
- Latest full same-fixture proofs emit no `fixture_events`, so the previous live `tokio_quiche` body/FIN timeout and non-fatal packet-open event noise are not reproducing in the current fixture state.
- Selected same-fixture RFC9220 and transport-only runs also emit real measured rows under `docs/benchmarks/native-h3-vs-rust-clients/2026-05-24-*-local.json`.

## What changed in this pass

- Added ACK decimation support through `QuicAckTracker::should_ack_after` and the H3/QUIC fingerprint knob `ack_eliciting_threshold`.
- Wired the native client driver to use fingerprint-controlled delayed application ACK emission instead of ACKing every inbound 1-RTT packet.
- Kept Chrome default ACK threshold at `16`; the H3 benchmark uses a tuned native proof threshold of `128` to demonstrate fingerprint/performance control.
- Added `H3Client::handle(url)` and `H3Handle::send_streaming(...)` so benchmarks and callers can reuse an already-open native H3 handle directly.
- Added a same-URL hot handle cache in `H3Client` to avoid repeated pool-key URL parsing and async pool locks on hot paths.
- Increased default H3 streaming body handoff slots from `8` to `64`.
- Made `h3_quinn` reuse one connection for warmups/samples instead of excluding connection setup while using a fresh connection per request.
- Made the full local fixture matrix isolate each client with a fresh fixture instance.
- Deferred native H3 receive-window MAX_DATA/MAX_STREAM_DATA flushing until after inbound DATA is applied to bounded streaming body queues, and retry deferred credit on public body progress.
- Added byte-level H3 response-body release accounting so the native driver only flushes queued receive-window credit for active streaming responses after public body consumption releases bytes.
- Queued RFC9220/WebSocket-over-H3 tunnel inbound DATA/FIN/GOAWAY when the public inbound channel is full, and wired tunnel reads to release receive credit and wake the native driver.
- Routed opened RFC9220 tunnel stream resets through the same queued inbound path so reset delivery is not dropped when the public tunnel channel is full.
- Changed native H3 tunnel receive pausing to wait until all open RFC9220 tunnel inbound queues are backpressured, so one slow tunnel no longer pauses socket reads while a sibling tunnel still has capacity.
- Changed native H3 receive pausing to consider active streaming-response and RFC9220 tunnel receive classes together, so a blocked response class no longer pauses tunnel reads, or vice versa, while another active class still has capacity.
- Added pending-ACK deadline tracking and native client delayed application ACK scheduling so ACKs flush on `max_ack_delay_ms` even when `ack_eliciting_threshold` is not reached.
- Wired the native mock H3 server and same-fixture benchmark H3 server to use the same threshold-or-`max_ack_delay_ms` ACK timer path instead of immediate application ACKs.
- Added ACK_ECN frame encode/decode support and made ACK_ECN ranges feed the native QUIC loss detector.
- Fixed native server QUIC transport parameters for required connection-ID fields and fixed server/client CID handling for 1-RTT packet routing.
- Added a same-fixture `specter_native_rfc9220_tunnel` benchmark row that opens RFC9220/WebSocket-over-H3 against the native fixture, echoes H3 DATA, and records TTFT/throughput separately from the H3 streaming superiority gate.
- Added transport-only `quinn_transport` and optional `s2n_quic_transport` same-fixture comparator adapters that open a raw QUIC bidirectional stream, echo payload bytes, and record measured TTFT/throughput outside the H3 superiority gate.
- Added fingerprint-level raw ordered QUIC transport parameters; when supplied, native H3 encodes that list exactly in caller order, bypasses typed/default/GREASE parameter emission, and preserves raw order in the H3 pool key.

## Remaining gaps

- Native QUIC still needs production-grade PTO/timer-driven retransmission, CRYPTO retransmission, close drain semantics, key update handling, version negotiation, Retry, ECN socket/counter plumbing beyond ACK_ECN frame parsing, and full path validation.
- Client/server same-fixture ACK decimation now has a `max_ack_delay_ms` timer path; capture-derived browser timing parity remains a production gap.
- The tuned benchmark proof uses `ack_eliciting_threshold = 128`; browser-capture parity still needs per-browser/version ACK behavior measurements.
- The latest full same-fixture proof emits no fixture packet-error events; keep the fixture event classification/audit path as a regression guard if third-party clients reintroduce late packet-open noise.
- `quinn_transport` and optional `s2n_quic_transport` now have measured transport-only comparator adapters; they remain non-H3 rows and are not required for the H3 superiority gate.
- RFC9220/WebSocket-over-H3 now has a Specter-native same-fixture tunnel row in the full proof; third-party/comparator tunnel rows and any tunnel superiority claim remain pending.
- TLS/H3 fingerprint gaps remain: certificate compression, extension ordering, session resumption, 0-RTT, capture-derived raw transport-parameter presets, and dynamic connection-ID placeholder handling inside raw ordered transport-parameter lists.
- H3 scheduling still lacks H2-style per-origin fair queue classes and fully adaptive send-window growth; receive-window credit for active streaming responses is now gated by public body-consumed bytes, while the absolute MAX_DATA/MAX_STREAM_DATA values are still generated by the existing receive-threshold logic. RFC9220 tunnel receive pausing now has sibling-tunnel and mixed tunnel/response receive-class fairness, but byte-precise encoded H3 frame credit remains open.

## Formatting note

Full `cargo fmt --check` still reports unrelated pre-existing formatting diffs in other modified worktree files such as `benches/codex_real_streaming.rs`, `benches/codex_ws_streaming.rs`, and Firefox tests. I avoided formatting those unrelated files in this pass.
